1.3	Aims
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main aim of this research is to save human lives from ongoing covid-19 worldwide pandemic by improving accurate disease prediction processing. And also help healthcare organizations to improve their services by designing Automatic Doctor Machine (ADM) and grow business using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Focus on decreasing human efforts, time and cost taken for dealing disease prediction. 

5	Machine Learning (ML)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1	Random Forest (RF)
5.2	K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
5.3	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5.4	Hybrid Support Vector Machine (Custom SVM)
5.5	Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
5.6	Logistic Regression (LR)
5.7	Decision Tree (DT)
5.8	Naive Bayes Model (NBM)

Best model for the dise
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modified version of the SVM model is more efficient for accuracy and time. Because it will provide the highest accurate result within fraction of the time and minimum resource utilization because this model took only 3 second for model feeding, fit, prediction of sample dataset
Accuracy = 98.4716%
